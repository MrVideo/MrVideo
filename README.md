# Hello everyone

I'm Mario, a second year student in Computer Engineering at **Politecnico di Milano**.
I'm a musician and I have fun making my own little projects with code in my free time.
I also collect videogames, especially vintage ones. I currently own a SNES, a Dreamcast, a bunch of Game Boys and DSs.
I am the community lead at **Google Developer Student Club @ PoliMi**

I am trying to learn as much as I can, and hopefully this GitHub profile will prove that in the future.

You can always find me on **Discord** `@xMrVideo#0001`, I'd love to chat with you!
