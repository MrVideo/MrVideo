# Hello everyone

I'm Mario, a BSc in Computer Engineering at **Politecnico di Milano**. I am currently studying for my MSc.
I'm a musician and I have fun making my own little projects with code in my free time.
I also collect videogames, especially vintage ones. I currently own a SNES, a Dreamcast, a bunch of Game Boys and DSs.
